"""`_get_last_seal` reads from the END of the ledger — same answers, O(1) cost.

(Sibling of measure-mirror's `tests/test_tail_seal.py`; the empty-ledger answer is
`GENESIS` here, and the ported reader additionally stops raising on non-object lines —
the previous version called `.get()` on whatever the line parsed to.)

The risk of this change is not that it is slow; it is that a chunked reverse read
answers `genesis` on a ledger that HAS a head. That would append a second genesis
entry into the middle of a live chain — a silent fork, and every integrity check
downstream would still pass, because each adjacent pair still links.

So the tests below are mostly about the seams the fast path introduced and the old
whole-file loop never had: chunk boundaries, line endings that text mode used to
normalise for us, and lines that are not JSON objects.

The equivalence test carries its own discriminating control (`test_comparator_can_fail`):
an equivalence suite that cannot report a difference proves nothing.
